## Design Patterns Part A

# Strategy Pattern
I want to utilize the strategy pattern in place of a few of the switch statements that could take place throughout the code.
I think this allow information to be decoupled and be able to change the context dynamically. 

# Singleton Pattern
I want to utilize a singleton for a battle ground or I could save the stats/results using a singleton as well.
Utilizing a singleton to allow one class to no more than one instance. 

# Factory Pattern
I want to utilize a factory pattern in order to implement a monster interface. This would allow an monstor object to be created
and obtained while the monstor types specifically would implement that interface.
